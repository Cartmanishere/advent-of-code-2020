# Advent of Code 2020

My attempt at solving [Advent of Code 2020 Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/).

All the problems are solved in both Clojure and Python.

It is interesting to observe the contrast between functional and procedural way of programming.

If possible, I will add implementations in Go, Javascript, Java, and C++.

In case anybody is interested to submit solutions in another language , PRs are very much appreciated.
